v0.1

*May 19, 2009*

Initial checkin to GitHub. Came across Ryan and Mario's code a while ago and
felt like it could be put together to make a pretty slick color wheel for
Flex 3. Alternatives in this area are quite limited. This version works, can
be used with the [PopUpManager][1] to have it hover near another control
(say, a swatch or something). The sliders update the wheel and dispatch
`change` events... it's pretty usable. Needs some UI love to make it obvious
to end users how to use it.
